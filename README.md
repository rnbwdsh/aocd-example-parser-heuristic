Advent-of-Code-Data Heuristic Example Parser
==================================

See [original heuristic parser](https://github.com/wimglenn/aocd-example-parser) and [advent-of-code-data](https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data) for basic info.

TL;DR: This is a plugin for aocd to extract example data from puzzle descriptions on the Advent of Code website. It is a heuristic parser, which means it is not guaranteed to work for all puzzles, following the template.

Feel free to do anything with the code.
